title: Chat with a PDF (With AI)

Today I read a [tweet](https://twitter.com/nilansaha/status/1699316803032453627) from [@nilansaha](https://twitter.com/nilansaha) jokingly naming three "innovative" ideas to create a SaaS. While I can understand the "joke" that there's nothing groundbreaking about creating the 501st app that already solves that problem, I think there's still a lot to be done in those areas.

The three ideas he mentions are:

- Tool to chat with a PDF
- AI Blog Generation
- AI Chatbot

If I focus on the first idea, there are already platforms such as [pdf.ai](https://pdf.ai/) solving this problem, but that does not mean that anything else can or should be done, I think that finding intersections or ramifications to that idea is where the true value lies, it would be interesting to investigate and create another value proposition.
