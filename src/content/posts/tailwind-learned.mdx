During this week I was reading and practicing the Tailwind CSS documentation extensively.

After several hours it becomes very intuitive, however, the learning curve is more similar to learning a new style language and I think many comments agree that the beginning is painful for that reason.

Now I will start implementing the styles on this website, I will be working all weekend on styling the page.
