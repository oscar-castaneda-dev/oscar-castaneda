title: Migrating to Tailwind CSS
---

I have been working with CSS for 12 years, well, not just pure CSS, but with its many flavors: Sass, Styled Components, CSS modules and even Bootstrap.

When you have been working with a technology for many years, you gradually detect problems in it. In the case of css, a serious problem in my opinion, is the number of styles that are repeated, and even if you or your team have good documentacion, good practices or even utility classes, at some point there will be repetitions.

These last few years I've been creating design systems in Sass, and although the result looked promising, at one point I realized some problems, mainly that new developers would have to learn the structure that I created, in addition to learning new style guides and do a deep review of each PR hoping not to find repetitions or remind them that we already had a class that solves that problem.

After thinking about it for months, I decided to migrate entirely to Tailwind, not just because it solved all the problems mentioned above, but because it is a very popular framework, with a huge documentation, more universal for the developers, there is no need to do extra work.

In my goal to create micro projects as quickly as possible, I think there is no faster way to start
incorporating styles than with Tailwind.

Throughout these weeks I will be reading the documentation and starting to implement it in this and the following projects.
