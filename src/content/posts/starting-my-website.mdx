Hello and welcome to my first post on this daily blog.

Beyond creating a portfolio or having my website, it was always in my plans to create a daily blog or a development blog inspired by the work of [Ben Stokes](https://twitter.com/tinyprojectsdev) and his [tiny projects](https://tinyprojects.dev/).

A bit of context. Ben is a web developer who creates digital products in the least amount of time, sharing his progress and experiences with the world, which has motivated me to follow in his footsteps.

Over the years, many projects have crossed my mind, however, I have never taken the time to carry them out, starting this website can be a good starting point

In the following days I will provide more details about this progress.
